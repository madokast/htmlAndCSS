  // Our Javascript will go here.
  //We have now set up the scene, our camera and the renderer.
  const scene = new THREE.Scene();

  const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
    //The first attribute is the field of view.
    // FOV is the extent of the scene that is seen
    // on the display at any given moment.
    // The value is in degrees.
    75,
    //The second one is the aspect ratio.
    // You almost always want to use the
    // width of the element divided by the height,
    // or you'll get the same result as when you
    // play old movies on a wide screen TV - the image looks squished.
    window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
    //The next two attributes are the near and far clipping plane.
    // What that means, is that objects further away from
    // the camera than the value of far or closer than
    // near won't be rendered. You don't have to worry about
    // this now, but you may want to use other values in your apps
    // to get better performance.
    0.1, 1000);

  //Next up is the renderer. This is where the magic happens.
  // In addition to the WebGLRenderer we use here,
  // three.js comes with a few others,
  // often used as fall-backs for users with older browsers
  // or for those who don't have WebGL support for some reason.
  const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

  //In addition to creating the renderer instance,
  // we also need to set the size at which we want it to render our app.
  // It's a good idea to use the width and height of the area we want
  // to fill with our app - in this case, the width and height of
  // the browser window. For performance intensive apps, you can also
  // give setSize smaller values, like window.innerWidth/2 and
  // window.innerHeight/2, which will make the app render at half size.
  renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

  document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

  //-----------------------add objects--------------------------

  //To create a cube, we need a BoxGeometry. This is an object that
  // contains all the points (vertices) and fill (faces) of the cube
  const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );

  //In addition to the geometry, we need a material to color it.
  // Three.js comes with several materials,
  // but we'll stick to the MeshBasicMaterial for now.
  // All materials take an object of properties which will be applied to them.
  // To keep things very simple, we only supply a color attribute of 0x00ff00,
  // which is green. This works the same way that colors work in CSS or
  // Photoshop (hex colors).
  const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );

  //The third thing we need is a Mesh.
  // A mesh is an object that takes a geometry,
  // and applies a material to it, which we then can insert to our scene,
  // and move freely around.
  const cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );

  //By default, when we call scene.add(),
  // the thing we add will be added to the coordinates (0,0,0)
  scene.add( cube );

  camera.position.z = 5;

  //-------------------render------------------
  //we need what's called a render or animate loop.
  //This will create a loop that causes the renderer
  // to draw the scene every time the screen is refreshed
  // (on a typical screen this means 60 times per second).
  function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame( animate );
    //some change
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
    renderer.render( scene, camera );
  }
  animate();
